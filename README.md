# Watermark
A GUI to easily add watermarks to ID cards

## Motivation

In everyday situations, there are many moments where you may need to send copies of your **identity documents** (e.g., at hotels, car rentals, or for administrative purposes).

Sending **scanned** or **photographed** identity documents comes with risks. It can facilitate **identity theft**, making it easier for anyone to impersonate you. 

A simple solution is to add a small **watermark** to the document, as shown in the image below:

There are many ways to add a watermark to a document, but they often have drawbacks:
- Some are **paid services**.
- Some are **time-consuming** to learn.
- Our ID card images may be stored in **multiple locations** on your machine.
- When using **online services**, we cannot be sure if they **store** your identity documents.

The goal of this GUI is to provide a **simple**, **free** solution for adding watermarks to your identity documents **quickly** and **easily**, without worrying about **privacy** or **security** issues.

## How to set it up?
### macOS / Linux / Windows
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the requirements (for instance, via conda).
```bash
conda env create -f conda/env.yml
conda activate watermark
```
3. Copy your personal ID to the image folder, and modify the input_image_path in main.py.
4. Run the main.py file.


### Android (Still in development)
Ensure **Docker** is installed on your system. You can find installation instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

On the root directory, build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t watermark:latest -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

Next, create the container:
```bash
docker run --rm -it --name watermark watermark:latest
```

Once inside, run on the shell:
```bash
buildozer -v android debug
```

The build process takes a considerable amount of time (approximately 20 minutes on my computer). During this process, Buildozer will prompt you to accept some licenses and it will download the necessary Android SDK components. In the end, you will find a file named **watermark-0.1-debug.apk** in the bin folder.

## How to use it?
The usage is very simple.

As seen in the image, the user only needs to write the text, select whether they want the resulting image in Black and White (**B&W**), and choose whether to hide the eyes and signature (**Hide ID**).
