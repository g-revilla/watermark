# Watermark
An Android app to easily add watermarks to ID cards

## Motivation

In everyday situations, there are many moments where you may need to send copies of your **identity documents** (e.g., at hotels, car rentals, or for administrative purposes).

Sending **scanned** or **photographed** identity documents comes with risks. It can facilitate **identity theft**, making it easier for anyone to impersonate you. 

A simple solution is to add a small **watermark** to the document, as shown in the image below:

There are many ways to add a watermark to a document, but they often have drawbacks:
- Some are **paid services**.
- Some are **time-consuming** to learn.
- Our ID card images may be stored in **multiple locations** on your phone.
- When using **online services**, we cannot be sure if they **store** your identity documents.

The goal of this app is to provide a **simple**, **free** solution for adding watermarks to your identity documents **quickly** and **easily**, without worrying about **privacy** or **security** issues.
